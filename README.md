# Data-Dignity

Data is ever-flowing, but the value it has is rarely discussed. This repo provides materials discussing Data Dignity , as proposed by RadicalXChange. It shall also feature the video made for the sake of an introduction to the subject and its importance.

Video explanation (Google Drive): [Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xOCPZVzSeW9QIompsIe6wVPsHaN4K2tS?usp=sharing)

Let's get social with it, spread the word ! : [Twitter Post](https://twitter.com/Naytlin2/status/1270827239354044423)

## Considerations on the project

* This is a project I am really happy to be working on and the fact that I managed to participate and submit my work is alone a thing
I am trully glad for
* I aimed at the video to be as informative as possible, using images that would suggest the right thing, while keeping the interest up and going
* The project is structured to show the perspectives of all participants in the data economy: the Data Producer and the Data Buyer. It culminates by 
showcasing a new emergent entity called a 'Data Coalition'

## Sources of information and Further Reading

* [Daily Data being produced](https://blog.microfocus.com/how-much-data-is-created-on-the-internet-each-day/)
* [Cellebrite hacking scandal](https://hive.blog/hive-122315/@v4vapid/cellebrite-can-hack-any-device-with-ufed-extraction-technology-or-dd18-the-wikileaks-archive) - this one is particularly intriguing , as it serves yet another example of how data is being used freely by companies to gain massive capabilities, yet the Data Producer ( us ) has nothing to gain from this.
* [Data Freedom Act](https://www.radicalxchange.org/files/DFA.pdf) - this was one of my main sources of inspiration and many more details may be found here
